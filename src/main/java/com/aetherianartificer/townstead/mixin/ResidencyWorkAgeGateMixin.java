/**
 * Defensive age gate for player-assigned employment. MCA's {@link Residency#setWorkplace} has no age
 * check of its own; it relies on the villager refusing interaction while a vanilla {@code isBaby()}.
 * {@code syncMcaAgeToStage} keeps that breeding age in step with the Townstead stage, but this also
 * refuses a pre-adult by the resolved STAGE directly, so a child can never be put to work through the
 * brief window before a freshly loaded breeding age is re-synced.
 *
 * <p>{@code remap=false}: the target lives in MCA, stable across both stonecutter branches.</p>
