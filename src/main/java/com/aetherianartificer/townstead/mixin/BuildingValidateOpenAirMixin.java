/**
 * Short-circuits {@link Building#validateBuilding} for open-air Townstead
 * types: docks (prefix {@code dock_}) and any type registered via the
 * data-driven enclosure index ({@code pen}, {@code compat/butchery/slaughter_pen},
 * and anything else authors flag with {@code townsteadEnclosure}). These all
 * have companion synthesizers (DockBuildingSync / EnclosureBuildingSync) that
 * actively build the Building from the detected shape; MCA's default
 * flood-fill-from-a-door-plus-roof would reject them as unroofed.
 *
 * <p>Using MCA's native grouped path instead would double-dip: MCA would
 * auto-create its own Building from the tracked blocks in parallel with our
 * synthetic, and every rescan would multiply the instance count. So these
 * types stay on this mixin and the synthesizers own the instance.
 *
 * <p>HEAD cancellable — per Townstead's mixin policy, vanilla and MCA
 * method call sites aren't stable targets across remap configs.
