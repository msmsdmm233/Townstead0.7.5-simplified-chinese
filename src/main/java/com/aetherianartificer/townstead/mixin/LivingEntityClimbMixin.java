/**
 * Spider-style wall climbing for a {@code climbing} entity, driven through vanilla's own per-tick
 * {@link LivingEntity#onClimbable()} (the once-per-10-ticks velocity nudge it replaced could not beat
 * gravity). Control scheme, for a player:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>hold crouch and push into a wall you face to grab it (crouch = change surface);</li>
 *   <li>once grabbed, push to climb up and stick in place rather than slide off (slide suppressed below);</li>
 *   <li>hold crouch again to wrap onto an adjoining surface (the movement controller owns this);</li>
 *   <li>jump to let go and fall.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Resolved per side by {@link MovementAbilities} so the owning client predicts what the server does.
 * The cling and sneak/jump controls are player-only: an AI villager keeps the basic push-to-climb so it
 * never freezes latched to a wall mid-path. We only ever turn a {@code false} into {@code true}
 * (ladders/vines already return true), so nothing existing is overridden. 1.20.1 Forge SRG: {@code
 * m_6147_} onClimbable, {@code m_5791_} isSuppressingSlidingDownLadder, {@code f_20899_} jumping.</p>
