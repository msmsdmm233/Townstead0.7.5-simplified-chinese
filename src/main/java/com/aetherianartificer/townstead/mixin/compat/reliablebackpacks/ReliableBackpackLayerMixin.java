/**
 * Soft compat with Reliable Backpacks. Unlike the cape/elytra/Backpacked back layers (which read
 * {@code getParentModel().body} live and so only need a {@link RigWearables#applyItem} nudge), Reliable
 * Backpacks' {@code BackpackLayer} caches the parent body bone <b>in its constructor</b>
 * ({@code parentBody = getParentModel().body}). It is built at {@code AddLayers} time, when the player
 * renderer's model is still the vanilla {@code PlayerModel} &mdash; so its cached bone is the vanilla
 * body, forever.
 *
 * <p>MCA swaps the renderer's model to its {@code PlayerEntityExtendedModel} inside {@code scale()},
 * which runs <i>before</i> {@code setupAnim} in {@code LivingEntityRenderer.render}. For a Root/genetics
 * player only that swapped model is animated (by the vanilla gait, by FA/PlayerAnimator, and by our own
 * animation bridge); the vanilla body the backpack copies from never gets {@code setupAnim} and sits at
 * rest. The pack still tracks the entity's world position and body-yaw (those live on the shared
 * {@code PoseStack}), so it looks attached but ignores the body bone's local lean/twist/sway &mdash; the
 * "doesn't follow the body animation" desync.</p>
 *
 * <p>Two injectors fix it: {@link #townstead$anchorBackpack} nudges a non-humanoid rig's back anchor
 * onto the item (parity with the other back layers), and {@link #townstead$copyFromLiveBody} redirects
 * the cached-body copy to read the live (swapped, animated) parent model instead. For a plain vanilla
 * player the swapped and cached models are the same object, so the redirect is a no-op there.</p>
 *
 * <p>Extends {@code RenderLayer} only to inherit its {@code protected getParentModel()}; the mixin's own
 * constructor is never applied to the target. {@code @Pseudo} + {@code require = 0} keep this inert when
 * Reliable Backpacks is absent, and let a future rename of its private {@code renderBaseLayer} fall back
 * to the mod's own behavior rather than crash. Reliable Backpacks ships only for 1.21+ (NeoForge/Fabric),
 * so the un-remapped vanilla names below resolve against the runtime's official mappings.</p>
