/**
 * Strips per-position {@code x/y/z} ints from every building's {@code blocks2}
 * entry in MCA's {@code GetVillageResponse} wire payload, before the
 * encoder writes the village {@link CompoundTag}. The encoder lambda's first
 * {@code StreamCodec.encode(buf, value)} call is the village snapshot, which
 * is the one that bloats; subsequent encode calls handle Rank, ids, tasks, and
 * building types and are left untouched via {@code ordinal = 0}.
 *
 * <p>The client tooltip in {@code BlueprintScreen} only reads
 * {@code List<BlockPos>.size()} per block-type key, so substituting empty
 * {@link CompoundTag}s for real position records preserves the displayed
 * count while collapsing each position's wire cost from ~30 bytes to 1.</p>
 *
 * <p>Companion to {@code GetVillageResponseLargePacketMixin}, which raises the
 * client decode cap as a belt-and-suspenders measure in case the slim payload
 * still grows large (many residents, many tasks, many building types).</p>
 *
 * <p><b>Legacy MCA only.</b> {@code TownsteadMixinPlugin} disables this mixin on
 * the floor-system build: that map renderer rebuilds building geometry from the
 * real {@code blocks2} coordinates, so stripping them empties the map (no icons
 * or outlines) and spams {@code BlockPos.CODEC} "Not a list: {}" decode errors.
 * There the raised decode cap alone carries the full payload.</p>
 *
 * <p>On 1.20.1 Forge, MCA encodes this payload through the legacy
 * {@code SimpleChannel}/{@code NbtDataMessage} path, so the Forge branch
 * slims the {@code CompoundTag} handed to {@code NbtDataMessage}'s
 * constructor instead.</p>
