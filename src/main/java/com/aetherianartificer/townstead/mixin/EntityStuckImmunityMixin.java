/**
 * A race with the {@code stuck_immunity} gene isn't slowed by the blocks it lists (a spider walking
 * through cobwebs). {@code makeStuckInBlock} is the single chokepoint cobwebs and sweet berry bushes use
 * to apply their drag, so skipping it at HEAD leaves the entity's motion untouched. The check is
 * side-aware ({@link StuckImmunity}): the server reads authoritative genes (villager movement), the
 * controlling client reads the synced set so a spider-folk player predicts the same and doesn't stick.
 * The gene lookup is only paid while actually inside such a block.
