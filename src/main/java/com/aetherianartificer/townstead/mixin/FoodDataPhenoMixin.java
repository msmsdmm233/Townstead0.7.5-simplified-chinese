/**
 * Pheno interception points on {@link FoodData} ({@code food} modifier, holder-side). FoodData has
 * no back-reference to its player, so we cache it from {@code tick(Player)} (the way Apoli's
 * HungerManagerMixin caches from update) and rescale the nutrition argument to
 * {@code eat(int, float)} ({@code m_38707_} on 1.20.1). Players only; MCA villagers eat through
 * Townstead's {@code VillagerConsumptionManager}, which applies the same modifier directly. All
 * logic is in {@link PhenoHooks}.
