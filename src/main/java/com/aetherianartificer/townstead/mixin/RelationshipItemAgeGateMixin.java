/**
 * Defensive age gate for relationship items (wedding/engagement ring). MCA's
 * {@link RelationshipItem#handle} rejects a marriage only when the villager is a vanilla
 * {@code isBaby()} (breeding age &lt; 0); {@code syncMcaAgeToStage} keeps that in step with the
 * Townstead stage, but this also refuses a pre-adult by the resolved STAGE directly, so a villager
 * can never be married through the brief window before a freshly loaded breeding age is re-synced.
 *
 * <p>{@code handle} returning {@code true} means "handled, with a failure message" (the caller, e.g.
 * {@code WeddingRingItem}, then does not marry), so we send the same "is baby" line MCA uses and
 * return true. {@code remap=false}: the target lives in MCA, stable across both stonecutter branches.</p>
