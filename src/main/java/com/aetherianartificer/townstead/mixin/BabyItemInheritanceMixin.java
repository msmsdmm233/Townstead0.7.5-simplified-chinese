/**
 * Applies inheritance to a baby-item birth (the player × villager path: a player
 * grows and places the baby item their villager spouse handed them). At
 * {@code birthChild}'s return the child is spawned and its parents are assigned,
 * so we resolve both parent entities and draw the child's heritage + alleles from
 * them. The player parent contributes its own origin's heritage (default Human).
 *
 * <p>This runs after MCA serialized/restored the dummy child, so working with the
 * live spawned entity avoids the baby-item NBT round-trip (which drops our
 * attachment-stored state). If a parent is unloaded it's simply skipped; with one
 * resolvable parent the child copies it, with none the founder seeding stands.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code remap=false}: the target lives in MCA (stable names both branches).</p>
