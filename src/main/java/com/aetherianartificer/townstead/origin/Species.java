/**
 * The shape/base-model category of a villager (Humanoid, and later Ribbit,
 * Kobold, …), and the bottom layer of the genome. A species can grant
 * {@code genes} that every ancestry/lineage/origin under it inherits (so
 * species-wide traits — a Ribbit's swimming, no-armor build — live here, not
 * repeated per origin). {@code shape} is an identifier reserved for model
 * selection; {@code humanoid} maps to MCA's default villager model.
 *
 * <p>Loaded from {@code data/<ns>/species/<path>.json}. {@code admixture_chance}
 * is the per-founder probability that a spawn of this species is a mixed-ancestry
 * blend of two or more of its origins instead of a single one (0 disables it).</p>
