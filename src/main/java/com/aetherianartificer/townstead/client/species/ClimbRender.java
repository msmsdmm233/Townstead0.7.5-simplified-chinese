/**
 * Spider gravity, stage 1 (model): rotates a climbing rig so the wall it is on becomes the floor, applied
 * to the WHOLE entity render (body + worn armor + held item together) so nothing comes apart. The hook is
 * {@code RenderLivingEvent.Pre}/{@code Post}: {@code Pre} fires before the entity's model, in the raw
 * world-aligned pose (before the renderer applies the body yaw), so the surface normal can be used
 * directly in world space; {@code Post} fires after the model but before the name tag, so the tag stays
 * upright. A push in {@code Pre} balanced by a pop in {@code Post} brackets exactly the model and its
 * layers. {@code Pre}/{@code Post} both fire for players (via {@code PlayerRenderer.super.render}).
 *
 * <p>Stage-1 scope: vertical walls only (the surface normal points out of the wall), no in-plane spin
 * correction yet; eased in/out by {@link ClimbState}. The camera/input stages reuse {@link #wallNormal}.</p>
