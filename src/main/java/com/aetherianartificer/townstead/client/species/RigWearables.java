/**
 * Re-poses a host humanoid's {@code body} and {@code head} bones onto a non-humanoid rig's real back
 * and head, so worn render layers that anchor to those bones (Backpacked/cape/elytra on the body,
 * helmet/pumpkin/mob-head on the head) land on the rig instead of floating at the default humanoid
 * chest/head. The host bones are invisible for an alternate rig (their layers are suppressed), so
 * moving them only affects those external attachments.
 *
 * <p>Each anchor is placed RELATIVE TO the matching rig bone: the host bone is moved onto the rig
 * bone's rest position (resolved through the rig's bone map — {@code body}-&gt;abdomen, {@code head}),
 * then the authored {@code offset}/{@code rotation} is a small nudge from there. So a pack author tunes
 * a pixel or two off the actual body part instead of typing the whole gap from the humanoid pose. The
 * spaces line up when the rig renders at scale 1.0; a scaled rig would need a scale correction here.</p>
 *
 * <p>The base anchor is applied once in the host model's {@code setupAnim}, which every back layer then
 * reads. A specific back layer can be nudged further: its render mixin calls {@link #applyItem} just
 * before it reads the bone, re-posing it to that layer's base+delta.</p>
