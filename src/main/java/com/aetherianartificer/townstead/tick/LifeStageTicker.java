/**
 * Drives Townstead life-stage progression on the server tick, independent of
 * MCA's {@code setAgeState}. MCA only fires setAgeState on its own AgeState
 * transitions (baby→…→adult) and never again once adult, so without a periodic
 * re-resolve an adult villager would never enter the Townstead SENIOR stage
 * (no hair desaturation, no speed penalty) as calendar days pass.
 *
 * <p>Two jobs:</p>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Periodically (once per in-game day) re-resolve the current stage from
 *       birth + stage days, committing {@code isSenior}; re-broadcasts the life
 *       sync when the senior flag flips so client hair desaturation updates.</li>
 *   <li>Every tick, reconcile the transient senior speed modifier against
 *       {@code isSenior} — {@code addTransientModifier} doesn't survive save/load,
 *       so a re-loaded senior would otherwise spawn back at full speed. Idempotent.</li>
 * </ul>
