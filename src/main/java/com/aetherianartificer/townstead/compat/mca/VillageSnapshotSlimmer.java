/**
 * Bounds the wire size of MCA's {@code GetVillageResponse} by truncating each
 * building's {@code blocks2} position lists to at most {@link #MAX_POSITIONS_PER_BLOCK}
 * entries per block id. The retained entries are the real, unmodified position
 * records, so they decode normally on every MCA version.
 *
 * <p><b>History.</b> The prior implementation replaced every position with an
 * empty {@link CompoundTag}, keeping only list lengths for MCA's old
 * {@code List<BlockPos>.size()} tooltip. That broke the floor-system client,
 * which rebuilds building geometry from the real coordinates: empty records fail
 * {@code BlockPos.CODEC} ("Not a list: {}") and the map renders nothing. Keeping
 * real (if truncated) positions renders correctly on both old and new MCA.
 *
 * <p><b>Role now.</b> Defense-in-depth. The actual payload bloat that once tripped
 * the 2 MiB {@link net.minecraft.nbt.NbtAccounter} cap came from ordinary houses
 * recording their walls, because Townstead's dock/pen requirement tags promoted
 * generic blocks to globally trackable; that is fixed at the source by
 * {@code BuildingTypeSyntheticBlockMixin}. Townstead's own synthetic buildings
 * already cap their seeded {@code blocks2} at 8 positions per block id. This
 * truncation remains as a ceiling for legacy save data that still carries
 * contaminated building block maps until MCA re-scans those buildings.
 *
 * <p>The cap is well above every building type's {@code minBlocks} requirement,
 * so {@code isComplete()} (hence map visibility) is never affected. The only
 * visible effect is that a building with more than {@value #MAX_POSITIONS_PER_BLOCK}
 * of one block type shows a capped count in the hover tooltip.
 *
 * <p>The result is a deep-copied {@link CompoundTag}; the caller never mutates
 * the live {@code Village} snapshot used by the running server.</p>
