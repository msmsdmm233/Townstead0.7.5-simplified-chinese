 * The body/base-model of a villager (Humanoid, and later Spider, Skeleton, …), and the

 * and lineages, and therefore by assignment profiles that select them (so species-wide
 * traits live here, not repeated per assignment profile). {@link #rig} is the model the
 * species renders as; the renderer reads its {@code base}.
 *
 * <p>Loaded from {@code data/<ns>/species/<path>.json}. {@code admixture_chance}
 * is the per-founder probability that a spawn of this species is a mixed-ancestry
 * blend of two or more of its origins instead of a single one (0 disables it).</p>
