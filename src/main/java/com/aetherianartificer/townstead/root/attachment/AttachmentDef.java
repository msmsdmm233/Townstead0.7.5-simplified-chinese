/**
 * The synced form of an attachment: render placement plus the SHA-1 hashes of its
 * geometry and texture blobs (the bytes are content-addressed and pulled/cached
 * separately). Authored as {@code data/<ns>/attachment/<id>.json}; the server
 * resolves the geometry/texture file references to hashes and syncs this view.
 *
 * <p>Targeting precedence: {@code targetTag} (every point carrying the tag, so one
 * "ears" attachment fits any rig that exposes an {@code ear} point) -> {@code targetPoint}
 * (one named point) -> {@code bone} (anchor straight to a model bone).</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code tintSource} draws the tint from the bearer instead of the flat
 * {@code tint}: resolved skin tone, rendered hair colour, or expressed eye
 * colour (author the texture in grayscale for these). {@code tintBlend} is how
 * the tint applies (multiply / screen / overlay / color — non-multiply modes
 * bake a derived texture client-side) and {@code tintStrength} fades it.
 * {@code emissiveSha1} is an optional second texture drawn full-bright over the
 * same geometry (glowing runes, foxfire tips); {@code translucent} renders the
 * whole attachment with alpha (wisps, membranes). Each {@code morph} channel reads one size
 * value rolled on the gene that granted this attachment: a channel with
 * {@code axes} scales its bones about their own pivots (each axis weighted;
 * 1 = follows the value fully, 0 = unaffected — no bones scales the whole
 * attachment at its anchor), and a channel with {@code rotate} turns its bones
 * by {@code rotate × value} degrees (a droop reads organic where a shrink reads
 * cheap). The single-channel shorthand maps to one anonymous channel.
 * {@code visibility} rules gate bones on channel values — a rounded human ear
 * tip shown only below a length threshold makes a quarter-elf read human rather
 * than miniature-elven.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code hidesUnder} lists armor slots ({@code helmet}/{@code chestplate}/
 * {@code leggings}/{@code boots}) that suppress the attachment entirely while the
 * bearer wears something there (horns vanish under a helm). The gentler option is
 * a {@code wearing_<slot>} pose that folds the attachment flat instead.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code stages} overrides render placement per canonical life stage
 * ({@code baby}/{@code toddler}/{@code child}/{@code teen}/{@code adult}/{@code senior}):
 * a scale multiplier, an extra offset, and optionally a whole different geometry
 * (baby elves get baby ears; elders can grow a longer model).</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code poses} are state-driven rotations evaluated client-side each frame:
 * an entry is active while its named state (sleeping, sprinting, ...) or its pheno
 * condition holds, and its rotations ease in/out over {@code transitionTicks}.
 * Active entries apply in authored order, later ones winning per bone.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code physics} chains give bones secondary motion: each chain is a root-to-tip
 * bone run simulated client-side as damped springs driven by the bearer's movement,
 * composing on top of poses and whatever animated the anchor.</p>
 *
 * <p>{@code animations} are Blockbench keyframe clips ({@code .animation.json},
 * blob-synced like geometry) triggered the same way poses are: while a named state
 * or pheno condition holds, or drawn from a {@code random_idle} pool. Clips fade
 * in/out over {@code transitionTicks} and compose between poses and physics, so a
 * keyframed swish still jiggles.</p>
