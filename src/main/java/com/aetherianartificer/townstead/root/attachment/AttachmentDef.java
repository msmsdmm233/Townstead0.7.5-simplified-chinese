 * The synced form of an attachment: render placement plus the SHA-1 hashes of its

 * resolves the geometry/texture file references to hashes and syncs this view.

 * <p>Targeting precedence: {@code targetTag} (every point carrying the tag, so one
 * "ears" attachment fits any rig that exposes an {@code ear} point) -> {@code targetPoint}
 * (one named point) -> {@code bone} (anchor straight to a model bone).</p>
