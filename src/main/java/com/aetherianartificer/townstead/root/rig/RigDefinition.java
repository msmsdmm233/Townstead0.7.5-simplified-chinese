/**
 * A data-pack rig: the body model a species renders as, its texture, the bone that plays each
 * animation role, and how it wears armor. Loaded server-side from {@code data/<ns>/rigs/*.json} (see
 * {@link RigJsonLoader}), synced to clients with the origin catalog, and referenced by id from a
 * species' {@code rig.base}. Lives in {@code data/} alongside species/genes so a pack author writes
 * all of a body in one place; rendering reads it from the synced client copy.
 *
 * <p>The {@code bones} map is what lets a custom rig use arbitrary bone names: each animation channel
 * ({@code head, headwear, body, right_arm, left_arm, right_leg, left_leg}) maps to the author's bone
 * name, so the animation bridge, held items, and armor address the right part. Vanilla bodies use the
 * identity map (channel name == bone name, with {@code headwear -> hat}).</p>
