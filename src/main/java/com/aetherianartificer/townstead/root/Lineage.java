/**
 * A lineage: a named specialization of an ancestry (e.g. Dark Elf under Elf),
 * with its own nomenclature. When an assignment profile references a lineage,
 * the founder genome starts from the union of its listed ancestries' genomes,
 * then this lineage's own {@link #genome()} is layered on top.
 *
 * <p>Heritage follows lineage in the conceptual Origins model. It records an
 * individual's realised ancestry composition and can name cross-ancestry
 * identities such as Half-Elves.</p>
 *
 * <p>Loaded from {@code data/<ns>/lineage/<path>.json}. None ship built-in; lineages are
 * authored by data packs.</p>
